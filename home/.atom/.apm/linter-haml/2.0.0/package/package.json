It will be\nused with files that have the \"HAML\" syntax.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThis plugin requires a separate package to be installed to run it and provide\nan interface. If [Linter][] is not\ninstalled already, it will be installed for you to provide this.\n\nLinter-haml relies on the HAML-lint gem to perform linting. If you do not\ncurrently have HAML-lint installed, follow the instructions [here][haml-lint].\n\nAs Atom doesn't include a HAML language by default, [language-haml][]\nwill be installed for you if it isn't already. You will likely want to disable\n`language-ruby` as it will mark all files as Ruby before `language-haml`.\n\nIf you prefer an alternative to any of the above packages that are installed\nfor you, simply disable them.\n\n### Plugin installation\n```\n$ apm install linter-haml\n```\n\n## Settings\n\n`linter-haml` can be configured from Atom's Settings menu in the Packages\nsection. All available options are shown there.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1.  Fork the plugin repository.\n2.  Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.\n3.  Commit and push the topic branch.\n4.  Make a pull request.\n5.  welcome to the club\n\n[linter]: https://atom.io/packages/linter\n[haml-lint]: https://github.com/causes/haml-lint\n[language-haml]: https://atom.io/packages/language-haml\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-haml/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-haml#readme","_id":"linter-haml@2.0.0","_shasum":"b62881a89c6ed7b38dd7890e19c4a96b1ef95206","_resolved":"file:../d-117211-67935-1dzpr78/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117211-67935-1dzpr78/package.tgz"}
