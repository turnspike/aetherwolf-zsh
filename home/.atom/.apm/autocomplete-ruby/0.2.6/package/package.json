Requires [RSense](https://github.com/rsense/rsense) and [Autocomplete+](https://github.com/atom-community/autocomplete-plus).\n\n## Status\nCurrently pre-alpha, buggy and not fully implemented. All help is welcome.\n\nNote: It doesn't seem like [RSense](https://github.com/rsense/rsense) is being developed any more. Any bugs/issues related to rsense itself will need to be reported in that repo, and probably won't be fixed.\n\n## Why?\nBecause I wanted Ruby code completion in Atom and [atom-rsense](https://github.com/rsense/atom-rsense) is broken and hasn't been updated since June 2014.\n\n## Installation\nMake sure you have Java installed on your machine.\n\nInstall rsense:\n```shell\n$ gem install rsense\n```\n\nIf you get an error about not being able to find `rsense` after opening a ruby file, you will need to set the path to the rsense binary in the plugin settings. The path is different depending on which OS/Ruby environment manager you are using. Executing `which rsense` or `gem environment` might help you locate it.\n\n## Usage\nJust type some stuff, and autocomplete+ will automatically show you some suggestions.\n\nNote: If you use Winows, it might take about 10 seconds after the first suggestions pop up before rsense will give you any suggestions.\n\n## Bugs\nA lot. If you're brave enough to try this out and notice any specifically, feel free to open an issue or even better submit a pull request.\n\n## Development\nClone the repository into your working directory:\n```shell\n$ git clone git@github.com:ianhattendorf/autocomplete-ruby.git\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n```shell\n$ cd autocomplete-ruby\n$ apm install\n```\n\nLink to Atom as a dev package:\n```shell\n$ apm link --dev\n```\n\nFeel free to fork it and submit a pull request for any changes you make.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"autocomplete-ruby@0.2.6","_shasum":"3308821ee6f1e7f69500e95abccc1f7d3b60d2ff","_resolved":"file:../d-117211-76141-881b1p/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117211-76141-881b1p/package.tgz"}
