Make sure, in its settings, the\nWorking Directory is set to \"Project\". This is the package's default, but might be different if you already had the package installed.\n\n![Ruby Test Settings view](http://cl.ly/image/1l3H0g1C1J3g/ruby-test-settings.png)\n\n## Run\n\nOpen the test file you want to run, then issue one of the following:\n\n* `cmd-ctrl-y` - Run all the test files\n* `cmd-ctrl-t` - Run the current test file\n* `cmd-ctrl-r` - Run the test at the current line in test file\n* `cmd-ctrl-e` - Re-run the previous test (doesn't need to have the test file active)\n\n## Features\n\n* Run all the tests in the project\n* Run the tests for current test file\n* Run single test at cursor\n* Run previous test\n* Configure the shell commands that run the tests\n* Supports Ruby managers, like `rvm` and `rbenv`\n* Supports bash, z-shell, fish\n* Supports Test::Unit, RSpec, Minitest, and Cucumber\n\n## Helpful Tips\n\n* Use ruby-test in conjunction with [project-manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager)\n  to maintain different ruby-test settings per project.\n* [Run ruby-test on a project that runs in a VM or Vagrant](https://github.com/moxley/atom-ruby-test/blob/master/doc/running_against_vm.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny of the following are appreciated:\n\n* [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/moxley/atom-ruby-test/pulls)\n* [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/moxley/atom-ruby-test/issues)\n",
