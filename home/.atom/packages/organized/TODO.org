* [TODO] Get to 1.0
  SCHEDULED: <2018-06-01 Fri>
* Outlining
  * [TODO] Support lettered indents
  * [TODO] Support roman numeral indenting
  * [TODO] Number indents need a new type of numbering on indent (7. becomes a. or 7.1 or something)
  * [TODO] If you have unindented and that unindent level has a different star type, adopt that star type
* Movement - keystrokes to move around
  * [TODO] Next/Prev bullet at same level
  * [TODO] Up to next highest level
  * [TODO] Move current bullet up / down
* Visibility cycling
  * [TODO] Add folding to menus to raise visibility
  * [TODO] Start supporting folding for '**' style stars (space-indented ones already work)
* Improve return key Support
  * [TODO] Figure out why I can't bind shift-enter correctly.
    * This might be due to peculiarity in chromium css specificity.
* [TODO] Add setting to autowrap at gutter
* [TODO] Different coloring depending on the number of stars in a star block
* [TODO] Properly support soft-tabs settings
* [TODO] Support Atom's auto tab type setting
  * Perhaps look at the first 1000 lines of a file -- see if we have more
    tab intentations or whitespace indentations.
  * Whichever line has the highest number wins
  * Ignore lines that have both
  * If sample size is too low, use more lines.

    * We should probably model parent-child relationship (parent outline node is a todo and it has children
      that also have todo items).
      * This would allow us to show todo items in search results with the children rolled up by default.  If we unrolled
        then all the items below would show up as well.

      * Simplenote doesn't really import simple text anymore, but this could still be a useful starting point.
